Fibernacci Service
==========

This project is a service based implementation of the Fibonacci suquence generator.  This application will accept a 
SOAP-based reuqest and provide a SOAP-based response.

The application provides a int primitive method that illistrates the limitation of 2**31 - 1 datatype.
The second method is a BigInteger implementation that provides a means to workaround the limitation.  
The only limitation is the input parameter.  

i.e. 

getSequence(int sequence_num) - int based

getBigSequence(long sequence_num) BigInteger based
